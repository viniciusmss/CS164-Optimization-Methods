# CS164-Optimization-Methods
Selected assignments and coding exercises from the class CS164: Optimization Methods. 
The notebooks may contain terms or concepts that targeted the description of the assignment or Minerva's grading structure. 
Such sections should not prevent the reader from understanding the code structure.

For a selected example, refer to [Robust Kalman Filtering for Path Retrieval](https://github.com/viniciusmss/CS164-Optimization-Methods/blob/master/Robust%20Kalman%20Filtering%20for%20Path%20Retrieval.ipynb) and its accompanying [report](https://github.com/viniciusmss/CS164-Optimization-Methods/blob/master/Robust%20Kalman%20Filtering%20for%20Path%20Retrieval.pdf).
