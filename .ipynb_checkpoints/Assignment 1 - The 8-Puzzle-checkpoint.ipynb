We do so by considering two subproblems where we are concerned only with half of the tiles. The relaxation allows us to calculate a more optimal estimate of the cost to the reach the goal in the original problem."

The heuristic is admissible as we can never overestimate the cost to the goal as the combined solution cost of these two disjoint subproblems can never be larger than the cost when they are solved at the same time. In the relaxed subproblem, we are ignoring the presence of the other tiles, hence making the original problem easier than it actually is. We implement a pattern database by considering all possible permutations of these subproblems and their associated costs.
